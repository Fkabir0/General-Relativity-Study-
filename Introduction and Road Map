There are a few things that I need to understand before fully grasping general relativity on a mathematical level. 
those things are In no specific order: 

Riemann Curvature Tensor

Ricci Tensor and Ricci Scalar
    - https://profoundphysics.com/the-ricci-tensor/
Weyl Tensor

Christoffel Symbols

The Metric Tensor
    - https://hepweb.ucsd.edu/ph110b/110b_notes/node74.html

Schwarzschild metric



this also includes a general understanding of 
tensor analysis 
differential geometry 
multivariable calculus 
linear algebra 

alongside this, I have to do a deep dive into Einstein's Field Equations

 Formulation and Solutions: Understanding the formulation of the Einstein field equations and finding exact solutions like the Schwarzschild solution.
 Stress-Energy Tensor: Represents the distribution of matter and energy in spacetime.

Additional concepts I might need to understand are 

Special Relativity: 
    - Lorentz Transformations: Basics of special relativity, which is a prerequisite for understanding general relativity.
    - Minkowski Space: The flat spacetime of special relativity.
Mathematical Physics

    - Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Mechanics: These form the basis for formulating classical field theories.
    - Variational Principles: These are used to derive equations of motion in general relativity.

Understanding the tools needed for this study: 
  - Software: Familiarize yourself with software tools like Mathematica, Maple, or Python libraries like SymPy and NumPy for symbolic and numerical computations.
